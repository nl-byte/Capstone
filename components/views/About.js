          <p>
            The United States established diplomatic relations with the
            Philippines in 1946. U.S.-Philippine relations are based on strong
            historical and cultural linkages and a shared commitment to
            democracy and human rights. The 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense
            Treaty provides a strong foundation for our robust post-World War II
            security partnership. Strong people-to-people ties, and economic
            cooperation provide additional avenues to engage on a range of
            bilateral, regional, and global issues. The U.S.-Philippine
            Bilateral Strategic Dialogue (BSD) is the annual forum for forward
            planning across the spectrum of our relationship. The most recent
            BSD took place in January 2023 when senior Philippine and U.S.
            foreign affairs and defense officials convened in Manila. More than
            four million Filipino-Americans live in the United States, and
            almost 300,000 U.S. citizens reside in the Philippines, including a
            large number of U.S. military veterans. Additionally, Manila is home
            to the only Veterans Administration regional office outside the
            United States, and the American Cemetery in Manila is the largest
            American military cemetery outside the United States. Pre-COVID,
            more than one million U.S. citizens visited the Philippines each
            year. People-to-people exchange programs between the United States
            and the Philippines include the longest continuously running
            Fulbright program in the world, the International Visitor Leadership
            Program, and the Kenney-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study program.
